## Resizer ##

__Resizer__ is a [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) run as a [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) that permits the dynamic resizing of multiple images belonging to a number of file extensions. Images may be input via the command line or via console prompt, and each entry requires both the file name of the target image existing in the present directory and a resize factor denoting the desired size of the new image (a factor of `2` indicates a resize of twice the present dimensions, while a factor of `.5` would produce an image half the original's present size, etc.) Newly resized images are created in the same directory as the original image at a new title reflecting the new image's dimensions.
