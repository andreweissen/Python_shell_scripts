## Pending Delete ##

__Pending Delete__, developed from a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) script of the author's previously called "AutoDelete," is a [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) run as a [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) that assists in automating the deletion of pages marked for pending deletion if the current date matches that of the pending deletion date provided in a special template in the wikitext markup.

As an example, after logging in the user via a `Special:BotPasswords` password, the script will fetch member pages existing in a category containing pages marked for eventual deletion. The script will request and search the wikitext content of each page for a certain template displaying the pending deletion date. If the current date matches the displayed deletion date, the page is deleted, though the user has to provide authorization and approve the deletion manually.

The script requires five arguments to function, namely, a username, a `Special:BotPasswords` password, a link to the `/api.php` resource on the wiki, the name of the template displaying the deletion date (without the `Template` namespace prefix), and the category in which the pages exist. If these are not included as command line arguments, the script will prompt the user to enter them manually.
