## Selective Delete ##

__Selective Delete__, named after a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) script of the same name developed by the author back in 2016/17, is a [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) run as a [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) that assists in automating the removal of pages marked for deletion if the page creator was the individual who tagged the page for deletion.

As an example, after logging in the user via a `Special:BotPasswords` password, the script will fetch member pages existing in a deletion category. The script will request information about each member's page creator and fetch the page's revision history. If the subsequent scan of the revisions reveals that the page creator was the user who tagged the article for deletion, the page is removed, though the script user has to provide authorization and approve the deletion manually.

The script requires five arguments to function, namely, a username, a `Special:BotPasswords` password, a link to the `/api.php` resource on the wiki, the name of the deletion temple, and the deletion category in which the pages exist. If these are not included as command line arguments, the script will prompt the user to enter them manually.
